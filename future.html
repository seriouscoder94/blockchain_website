                        <p class="dark-text">Just like switching to LED bulbs saves energy, we're making blockchain more eco-friendly. These new systems use as much power as a light bulb instead of an entire house!</p>

                        <p class="dark-text">Major banks and companies start using blockchain for everyday operations. Think of your bank transfers becoming instant and available 24/7, or tracking your package's journey from factory to doorstep with 100% accuracy. Companies like Walmart and Amazon will use blockchain to verify products are genuine - no more fake items!</p>

                        <p class="dark-text">Blockchain becomes super energy-efficient. New systems will use 99% less energy - like switching from a power-hungry gaming PC to a small tablet. Carbon credits and environmental projects get tracked on blockchain, making it easier for everyone to help fight climate change. Your electric car could automatically charge when renewable energy is abundant!</p>

                        <p class="dark-text">Money moves as easily as sending a text message. Pay for coffee with any currency instantly, split bills with friends automatically, or earn money while sleeping through smart contracts. Your social media posts could earn you real money, and video games could have real economies where items have actual value. Plus, voting in elections becomes completely secure and verifiable!</p>
