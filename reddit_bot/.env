This course is an incredible opportunity to develop your critical thinking, analytical, and writing skills, so come prepared to grow both academically and personally. In this class, you will explore diverse literary works, analyze texts, and learn how to construct compelling arguments. Expect to write essays, engage in discussions, and think deeply about how literature reflects and shapes our world. The class emphasizes breaking down complex ideas and expressing them clearly—skills that will benefit you in any field of study. The most challenging part? Time management and interpreting literature on a deeper level. 

This class taught me to articulate my thoughts more effectively and approach writing as a process. Initially, I struggled with analyzing texts beyond surface-level themes, but through practice and feedback, I learned to dig deeper. One of my proudest moments was writing an essay on the representation of young women in corporate fields in Legally Blonde, where I connected media analysis with broader societal themes. That experience helped me feel more confident about my ability to interpret complex ideas and tie them to larger conversations. However, it wasn’t always easy. Balancing assignments with other responsibilities felt overwhelming at times, and I often second-guessed my interpretations. What helped me the most was breaking assignments into manageable tasks and being open to revising my work multiple times.

A song lyric that resonates with my experience in this class is from “The Climb” by Miley Cyrus: “There’s always gonna be another mountain / I’m always gonna wanna make it move.” This lyric reflects the challenges and rewards of ENG 1102. Each assignment felt like a mountain to climb, but the process of pushing myself made the journey worthwhile. If you embrace the challenges with an open mind and determination, you’ll discover new strengths within yourself.
